apt-offline (0.9.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Bug Fix Release
    + Allow release type to be specified when in the set operation, for
      an upgrade. (This is the equivalent of `apt-get -t unstable upgrade`) 
    + Add new option --simulate (which replaces the old --test-windows option)
    + Do a check to ensure that the argument to the 'get' operation is a file
    + Fix APT/GPG security issues. When just running the 'set' operation, the
      apt gpg database gets invalid. Currently, fixed with a workaround. For
      more details, see DBTS: 565918
      Many thanks to Paul Nijjar for reporting the bug
  * Update Standards Version to 3.8.4 (No changes required)
